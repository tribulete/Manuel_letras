### Lonely Boy

**[Estrofa 1]**

Well, I'm so above you  
And it's plain to see  
But I came to love you anyway  
So you pulled my heart out  
And I don't mind bleedin'  
Any old time, you keep me waitin'  
Waitin', waitin'  

**[Estribillo]**

Oh, whoa, oh  
I got a love that keeps me waitin'  
Oh, whoa, oh  
I got a love that keeps me waitin'  
I'm a lonely boy  
I'm a lonely boy  
Oh, whoa, oh  
I got a love that keeps me waitin'  

**[Estrofa 2]**

Well, your mama kept you  
But your daddy left you  
And I should've done you just the same  
But I came to love you  
Am I born to bleed?  
Any old time, you keep me waitin'  
Waitin', waitin'  

**[Estribillo]**

Oh, whoa, oh  
I got a love that keeps me waitin'  
Oh, whoa, oh  
I got a love that keeps me waitin'  
I'm a lonely boy  
I'm a lonely boy  
Oh, whoa, oh  
I got a love that keeps me waitin'  

**[Puente]**

Hey  

**[Estribillo final]**  
Oh, whoa, oh  
I got a love that keeps me waitin'  
Oh, whoa, oh  
I got a love that keeps me waitin'  
I'm a lonely boy  
I'm a lonely boy  
Oh, whoa, oh  
I got a love that keeps me waitin'
