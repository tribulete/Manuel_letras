# Someday

**[ESTROFA 1]**  
In many ways, still miss the good old days  
Someday, someday  
Yeah, it hurts to say, but I want you to stay  
Sometimes, sometimes  
When we was young, oh man, did we have fun?  
Always, always  
Promises, they break before they're made  
Sometimes, sometimes  

**[ESTROFA 2]**  
Oh, my ex says I'm lacking in depth  
I will do my best  
You say you wanna stay by my side  
Darling, your head's not right  
I see alone we stand together we fall apart  
Yeah, I think I'll be alright  
I'm working so I won't have to try so hard  
Tables they turn sometimes  
Oh, someday, yeah  
No, I ain't wastin' no more time  

Trying, trying  

**[ESTROFA 3]**  
And now my fears, they come to me in threes  
So I, sometimes  
Say, "Fate, my friend, You say the strangest things  
I find, sometimes"  

**[ESTROFA 4]**  
Oh, my ex says I'm lacking in depth  
Shit, I will try my best  
You say you want to stay by my side  
Darling, your head's not right  
I see alone we stand together we fall apart  
Yeah, I think I'll be all right  
I'm working so I won't have to try so hard  
Tables they turn sometimes  
Oh, someday  
I ain't wasting no more time
