# Wake Up

**[Estrofa 1]**  
Somethin' filled up  
My heart with nothin'  
Someone told me not to cry  
Now that I'm older  
My heart's colder  
And I can see that it's a lie

oooooh ooohhh  .....

**[Estrofa 2]**  
Children, wake up  
Hold your mistake up  
Before they turn the summer into dust  
If the children don't grow up  
Our bodies get bigger 
but our hearts get torn up  

We're just a million 
little god's causin' rain storms  
Turnin' every good thing to rust  
I guess we'll just have to adjust

oooooh ooohhh

**[Puente]**  
With my lightnin' bolts a-glowin  
I can see where I am goin' to be  
When the reaper he reaches and touches my hand

**[Outro]**  
With my lightnin' bolts a-glowin'  
I can see where I am goin'  
With my lightnin' bolts a-glowin'  
I can see where I am go, goin'  
You better look out below
