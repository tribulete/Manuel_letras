# Common People

**[ESTROFA 1]**  
She came from Greece she had a thirst for knowledge  
She studied sculpture at St. Martin's college  
That's where I  
Caught her eye  
She told me that her dad was loaded  
I said: In that case I'll have rum and Coca-Cola  
She said: Fine  
And then in thirty seconds time she said  

**[ESTRIBILLO]**  
"I want to live like common people  
I want to do whatever common people do  
I want to sleep with common people  
I want to sleep with common people like you  
Well, what else could I do?  
I said: I'll see what I can do  

**[ESTROFA 2]**  
I took her to a supermarket  
I don't know why, but I had to start it somewhere  
So it started there  
I said: Pretend you've got no money  
But she just laughed an said: Oh, you're so funny  
I said: Yeah?  
Well, I can't see anyone else smiling in here  
Are you sure you want to live like common people  
You want to see whatever common people see  
You want to sleep with common people  
You want to sleep with common people like me?  
But she didn't understand  
She just smiled and held my hand  

**[ESTROFA 3]**  
Rent a flat above a shop  
Cut your hair and get a job  
Smoke some fags and play some pool  
Pretend you never went to school  
But still you'll never get it right  
'Cause when you're laid in bed at night  
Watching roaches climb the wall  
If you called your dad he could stop it all, yeah  

**[ESTRIBILLO]**  
You'll never live like common people  
You'll never do whatever common people do  
You'll never fail like common people  
You'll never watch your life slide out of view  
And then dance and drink and screw  
Because there's nothing else to do  

**[PUENTE]**  
Sing along with the common people  
Sing along and it might just get you through  
Laugh along with the common people  
Laugh along even though they're laughing at you  
And the stupid things that you do  
Because you think that poor is cool  

**[ESTROFA 4]**  
Like a dog lying in a corner  
They will bite and never warn you  
Look out  
They'll tear your insides out  
'Cause everybody hates a tourist  
Especially one who thinks it's all such a laugh  
And the chip stain's grease will come out in the bath  
You will never understand  
How it feels to live your life  
With no meaning or control  
And with nowhere else to go  
You are amazed that they exist  
And they burn so bright whilst you can only wonder why  

**[ESTROFA 3 REPETIDA]**  
Rent a flat above a shop  
Cut your hair and get a job  
Smoke some fags and play some pool  
Pretend you never went to school  
But still you'll never get it right  
'Cause when you're laid in bed at night  
Watching roaches climb the wall  
If you called your dad he could stop it all  

**[ESTRIBILLO]**  
You'll never live like common people  
You'll never do what common people do  
You'll never fail like common people  
You'll never watch your life slide out of view  
And dance and drink and screw  
Because there's nothing else to do  

**[OUTRO]**  
I want to live with common people like you  
I want to live with common people like you  
I want
