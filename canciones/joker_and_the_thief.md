# Joker and the Thief

**[Estrofa 1]**  
I said the joker is a wanted man  
He makes his way all across the land  
See him sifting through the sand  
So I'll tell you all the story  
About the joker and the thief in the night  

**[Estrofa 2]**  
He's always laughing in the midst of power  
Always living in the final hour  
There is always sweet and sour  
So we are not going home  

**[Estribillo]**  
Can you see the joker flying over  
As she's standing in the field of clover?  
Watching out everyday  
I wonder what would happen if he took her away  

**[Estrofa 3]**  
What you see, well, you might not know  
You get the feelin', comin' after the glow  
The vagabond is moving slow  
So I'll tell you all the story  
About the joker and the thief in the night  

**[Estrofa 4]**  
All the people that you see in the night  
Hold their dreams up to the light  
The wild beast is searching for sight  
And we are not going home  

**[Estribillo]**  
Can you see the joker flying over  
As she's standing in the field of clover?  
Watching out everyday  
I wonder what would happen if he took her away  

**[Coda]**  
I said the joker is a wanted man  
He makes his way all across the land  
See him sifting through the sand  
So I'll tell you all the story  
About the joker and the thief  

I said I'll tell you all the story  
About the joker and the thief  

I said, I'll tell you the story  
About the joker and the thief in the night
