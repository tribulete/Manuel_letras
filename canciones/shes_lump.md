# She's Lump

**[Estrofa 1]**  
Lump sat alone in a boggy marsh  
Totally motionless except for her heart  
Mud flowed up into Lump's pajamas  
She totally confused all the passing piranhas  

**[Estribillo]**  
She's Lump, she's Lump  
She's in my head  
She's Lump, she's Lump, she's Lump  
She might be dead  

**[Estrofa 2]**  
Lump lingered last in line for brains,  
And the ones she got were sort of rotten and insane  
Small thing's so sad that birds could land  
Is Lump fast asleep or rockin' out with the band?  

**[Estribillo]**  
She's Lump, she's Lump  
She's in my head  
She's Lump, she's Lump, she's Lump  
She might be dead  

**[Estrofa 3]**  
Lump was limp and lonely and needed a shove  
Lump slipped on a kiss and tumbled into love  
She spent her twenties between the sheets  
Life limped along at subsonic speeds  

**[Estribillo]**  
She's Lump, she's Lump  
She's in my head  
She's Lump, she's Lump, she's Lump  
She might be dead  

**[Puente / Outro]**  
Is this Lump out of my head, I think so  
Is this Lump out of my head, I think so, yeah  
Is this Lump out of my head, I think so  
Is this Lump out of my head...
