**[ESTRIBILLO]**  
Woo-hoo  
Woo-hoo  
Woo-hoo  
Woo-hoo  

**[ESTROFA 1]**  
I got my head checked  
By a jumbo jet  
It wasn't easy  
But nothing is, no  
when I feel heavy metal  
(Woo-hoo) and I'm pins and I'm needles  
(Woo-hoo) well, I lie and I'm easy  
All of the time, but I'm never sure why I need you  
Pleased to meet you  

**[ESTROFA 2]**  
I got my head done  
When I was young  
It's not my problem  
It's not my problem  
when I feel heavy metal  
(Woo-hoo) and I'm pins and I'm needles  
(Woo-hoo) well, I lie and I'm easy  
All of the time, but I'm never sure why I need you  
Pleased to meet you  

**[ESTRIBILLO]**  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
Oh, yeah
