# The Skin of My Yellow Country Teeth

**[Estrofa 1]**  
Once - The dogs have quit their barking  
"Son" - My neighbor said to me  
"Know" - the emptiness of talking blue  
The same old sheep"

Run - I'll do no more this walking  
Haunted by a past I just can't see  
Anymore Anymore  

**[Estribillo]**  
But let me tell you  
I have never planned  
To let go of, the hand that has been clinging  
by its thick, country skin  
To my yellow country teeth  
To my yellow country teeth

**[Estrofa 2]**  
Far - Far away from West Virginia  
I - Will try on New York City  

**[Estribillo]**  
Explaining that the  
sky holds the wind, the sun rushes in  
And a child with a shotgun  
can shoot down honeybees, that sting  
But this boy could use a little sting  
Alright  

**[Estrofa 3]**  
Who - Will get me to a party?  
Who - Do I have yet to meet?  
You - You look a bit like coffee  
And you taste a bit like me  

How - Can I keep me from moving?  
Now - I need a change of scenery  

**[Estribillo]**  
Just listen to me  
I won't pretend, to understand  
the movement of the wind  
Or the waves out in the ocean  
or how like the hours, I change softly  
slowly, plainly, blindly, oh me, oh myyy!
