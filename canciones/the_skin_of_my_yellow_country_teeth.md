# The Skin of My Yellow Country Teeth

**[Estrofa 1]**  
Once  
The dogs have quit their barking  
"Son"  
My neighbor said to me  
"Know the emptiness of talking blue  
The same old sheep"

**[Estrofa 2]**  
Run  
I'll do no more this walking  
Haunted by a past I just can't see  
Anymore  
Anymore

**[Estribillo]**  
But let me tell you I have never planned  
To let go of the hand that has been  
Clinging by its thick country skin  
To my yellow country teeth  
To my yellow country teeth
