# The Skin of My Yellow Country Teeth

**[Estrofa 1]**  
Once  
The dogs have quit their barking  
"Son"  
My neighbor said to me  
"Know the emptiness of talking blue  
The same old sheep"

Run  
I'll do no more this walking  
Haunted by a past I just can't see  
Anymore

**[Estribillo]**  
But let me tell you I have never planned  
To let go of the hand that has been  
Clinging by its thick country skin  
To my yellow country teeth  
To my yellow country teeth

Will try on New York City

Explaining that the sky holds the
Wind, the sun rushes in
And a child with a shotgun can shoot down
Honeybees that sting
But this boy could use a little sting
Alright

**[Estrofa 3]**  
Who
Will get me to a party?
Who
Do I have yet to meet?

You look a bit like coffee
And you taste a bit like me


How
Can I keep me from moving?
Now
I need a change of scenery
Just listen to me I won't pretend to
Understand the movement of the wind
Or the waves out in the ocean or how
Like the hours I change softly slowly
Plainly blindly oh me oh my
