Looking at life through the eyes of a tyre hub

Eating seeds as a past time activity

The toxicity of our city, of our city

New! What do you own the world?

How do you own disorder, disorder

Now, somewhere between the sacred silence

Sacred silence and sleep

Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep

Disorder, disorder, disorder

More wood for their fires, loud neighbors

Flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck

Eating seeds as a past time activity

The toxicity of our city, of our city

New! What do you own the world?

How do you own disorder, disorder?

Now, somewhere between the sacred silence

Sacred silence and sleep

Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep

Disorder, disorder, disorder

New, what do you own the world?

How do you own disorder, disorder?

Now, somewhere between the sacred silence

Sacred silence and sleep

Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep

Disorder, disorder, disorder

When I became the sun

I shone life into the man's hearts

When I became the sun

I shone life into the man's hearts
